# quarto sources the "Spatial Data Science" book.

A rendered (html) version of this book is available [here](https://r-spatial.org/book).
The pdf version has been submitted to CRC/Chapman and Hall, for hardcopy publication.

To recreate/reproduce this book:

* git clone this repository
* download the data used in Ch 13 from https://uni-muenster.sciebo.de/s/8mEbeHPOX9GdAYn, and extract the contents of the `aq` subdirectory into `sdsr/aq`
* install all R packages listed under [Dependencies](#dependencies)
* install [quarto](https://quarto.org/) 
* run `quarto render --to html`

See also the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/edzer/sdsr/tree/main/docker); building the (18 Gb) image with
```
docker build . -t sdsr --build-arg TZ=`timedatectl show --property=Timezone | awk -F = '{print $2}'`
```
and running it with
```
docker run -p 8787:8787 -e DISABLE_AUTH=true -ti --rm sdsr
```
will serve an Rstudio server instance on <http://localhost:8787/>, without authentication.

After running the docker image and opening `rstudio` in the browser:

* click on `01-hello.qmd` in the bottom-right pane
* click on the `Render` button of the top-left pane to compile the whole book
* this should open a new browser window with the full book rendered (switch off popup blocker for localhost)
* to run a selected code section, possibly after modification, find the selected code section in the corresponding `.qmd` file, and click the small green arrow symbols on the top-right corner of the code blocks:
    * to prepare, first click `Run All Chunks Above`,
	* to run the selected section: click `Run Current Chunk`
